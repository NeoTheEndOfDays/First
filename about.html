                 <h1> Hi! Thank You for visiting my site.</h1>
                <p>Welcome to my first site as a Developer.
                If you do not know me I am The Apex, also known as the End Of Days.
                I am the sole programmer of this site.</p>

             <p>This is a site developed by a Tech-intellectual for other intellectuals, Programmers and tech enthusiasts as well as pretty much anyone seeking tech help and/or advice.</p>
           
            <p> The site is currently still under development as it is new, so please be aware that there's still lots of changes to come.</p>
              
                  <p> Have a great day.</p>
